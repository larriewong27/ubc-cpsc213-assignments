When running sRead.c, we timed the execution of the program for three different number of blocks read by the disk.

10 blocks read by the disk: 
real	0m0.178s
user	0m0.105s
sys	0m0.004s

100 blocks read by the disk:
real	0m1.078s
user	0m1.051s
sys	0m0.017s

1000 blocks read by the disk:
real	0m10.762s
user	0m10.543s
sys	0m0.139s

We notice that there is a linear relationship between the number of blocks read by the disk and the execution time because each disk read is synchronous so they occur one after another and they take 10ms. This gives a linear runtime complexity.
